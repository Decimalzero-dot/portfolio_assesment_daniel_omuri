   🌟 PROJECT TITLE: Daniel Omuri | Frontend Developer Portfolio
A sleek, modern, and fully responsive developer portfolio built to showcase my core frontend skills and personal projects using a unified dark-mode aesthetic.

   ✨ FEATURES
Responsive Layout: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for a fluid layout, ensuring optimal viewing on all desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic Content Toggle: Interactive detail cards (Study Path, Projects, Contacts) use reliable Vanilla JavaScript to show/hide content on button click (display: block/none).

Non-Reloading Form: Contact form submission is handled purely by JavaScript using e.preventDefault() to process data without reloading the page.

One-Page Navigation: Smooth anchor links (scroll-behavior: smooth) enable seamless navigation between sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, etc.).

Modern Aesthetics: Features a dark-mode color palette (#1F282E - Dark Slate Gray) with vibrant neon accents (pink/magenta and yellow/cyan) for a professional, high-tech feel.

Component-Based Styling: Leverages the Bootstrap 5 CDN for utility classes (e.g., form styling, button styling).

  💻 TECHNOLOGY USED
HTML5 (Semantic Structure, including <header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>)

CSS3 (Custom Styling, CSS Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries)

Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Form Submission Logic)

Bootstrap 5 (CDN for basic component styling)
